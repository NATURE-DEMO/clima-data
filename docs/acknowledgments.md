## Climate Data Sources

We gratefully acknowledge the following data providers and climate modeling initiatives:

### Primary Data Sources

- **[Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu)**: The European Union's Earth observation programme, providing access to comprehensive climate data.
- **[CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment)](https://www.cordex.org)**: The World Climate Research Programme's framework for coordinated regional climate downscaling.
- **EURO-CORDEX**: The European domain of CORDEX, providing high-resolution regional climate projections for Europe.
- **[Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov)**: The international collaboration for climate model data distribution and access.


## Scientific Libraries and Software

This work builds upon the outstanding contributions of the scientific Python community:

### Core Climate Science Libraries

- **[xclim](https://xclim.readthedocs.io/)**: Climate indices calculation library, essential for computing climate indicators.
- **[xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/)**: Multi-dimensional array processing for climate data analysis.
- **[netCDF4](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/)**: Python interface to the netCDF C library for handling climate data files.

### Geospatial and Data Processing

- **[cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/)**: Geospatial data processing and cartographic projections.
- **[geopandas](https://geopandas.org/)**: Geographic data analysis in Python.
- **[dask](https://dask.org/)**: Parallel computing for large-scale climate data processing.
- **[zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/)**: Chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays.

## Climate Risk Assessment Framework

We acknowledge the **[CLIMAAX project](https://handbook.climaax.eu/)** (CLIMAte risk and vulnerability Assessment framework and toolboX), funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101093864. CLIMAAX develops standardized climate risk assessment frameworks and toolboxes that support consistent and accessible climate risk analysis across European regions.
