- **Units**: Align with CORDEX/CDS specifications (e.g., `pr` in `kg.m⁻².s⁻¹`, `tas` in `K`)
- **Temporal resolution**: Variables are available at 3-hourly, daily, monthly, or seasonal frequencies, which in the CDS API are indicates as `3hr`, `daily_mean`, `monthly_mean`, `seasonal_mean`, respectively (non-European domains only include daily data).
- **Static variables**: `sftlf` (land area fraction) and `orog` (topography) are time-independent
- **Standard Names**: Standard naming following CF conventions can be found in [CORDEX Variable Requirements Table](https://is-enes-data.github.io/CORDEX_variables_requirement_table.pdf)
